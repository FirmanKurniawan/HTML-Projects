        <img src="assets/img/troll.jpg" class="featured-image">

        <p>Queen Poppy and Branch make a surprising discovery — there are other Troll worlds beyond their own, and their
          distinct differences create big clashes between these various tribes. When a mysterious threat puts all of the
          Trolls across the land in danger, Poppy, Branch, and their band of friends must embark on an epic quest to
          create harmony among the feuding Trolls to unite them against certain doom.</p>

        <h2><a href="tv1.html">The Flash</a></h2>

        <img src="assets/img/flash.jpg" class="featured-image">

        <p>After a particle accelerator causes a freak storm, CSI Investigator Barry Allen is struck by lightning and
          falls into a coma. Months later he awakens with the power of super speed, granting him the ability to move
          through Central City like an unseen guardian angel. Though initially excited by his newfound powers, Barry is
          shocked to discover he is not the only "meta-human" who was created in the wake of the accelerator explosion
          -- and not everyone is using their new powers for good. Barry partners with S.T.A.R. Labs and dedicates his
          life to protect the innocent. For now, only a few close friends and associates know that Barry is literally
          the fastest man alive, but it won't be long before the world learns what Barry Allen has become...The Flash.

        <img src="assets/img/got.jpg" class="featured-image">

        <p>Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Friction between the houses leads to
          full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war, a neglected
          military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors
          beyond.</p>
