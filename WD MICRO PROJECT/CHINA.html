        <p>Many of us want an overview of how our country is doing in reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. This page provides the data for your chosen country across all of the key metrics on this topic.

        In the selection box above you can also add or remove additional countries and they will appear on all of the charts on this page. This allows you to compare specific countries you might be interested in, and measure progress against others.</p><br>

            Annual emissions figures are often used to compare countries contribution to climate change. But this metric often reflects differences in population size across the world. To understand the footprint of the average person in a given country, this chart shows per capita emissions. These figures reflect production-based emissions, so do not correct for traded goods.

            When we only look at emissions produced today, we fail to recognise historical responsibility for emissions in recent decades or centuries.This interactive chart shows cumulative CO2 emissions the sum of emissions produced since 1751 to the given year. This allows us to understand how much of the total CO2 emissions to date has been emitted by a given country India.
